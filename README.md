# Agent Orchestration Landscape Survey

![Agent Orchestration Landscape](./media/thumbnail.jpg)

## Overview

This repository hosts a comprehensive, interactive survey of the AI agent orchestration landscape as of early 2026. It serves as a centralized resource for developers, researchers, and enterprises to explore the rapidly evolving ecosystem of agent frameworks, benchmarking tools, and datasets.

The project features a responsive web interface that categorizes tools into key segments:
*   **Code-First Frameworks:** Libraries designed for developers building complex, multi-agent systems (e.g., LangGraph, AutoGen).
*   **Visual / Low-Code Platforms:** Tools enabling non-technical users to design agent workflows (e.g., n8n, Flowise).
*   **Enterprise Solutions:** Managed services focusing on security, scale, and compliance (e.g., Azure AI Agent Service).
*   **Benchmarking:** Essential utilities for evaluating agent performance, reliability, and safety.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

### How to Contribute: Adding Items
1.  **Add a Framework:** If a tool is missing, please submit a Pull Request adding it to the `rawData` array in `index.html`. Ensure all fields (philosophy, proficiency, setup, etc.) are completed.
2.  **Update Data:** Correct outdated information regarding features, pricing models, or documentation links.

### Contribute: Improve Web Page
The web page can be improved in various ways. For now, it's just a quick single-page HTML. 
1.  **Enhance the UI:** Improvements to the visualization, filtering logic, or design are encouraged.
2.  **Improve Code Structure**: Separate logic from data (move CSS and JS to separate files).
3.  **Add Examples**: Find good examples and add them in a way the fits the design.
